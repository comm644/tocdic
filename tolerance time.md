## tolerance time

<b>tolerance time</b> - The time a customer is willing to wait from when they place an order until they receive the product. 


Usage: In many cases, the customer tolerance time is less than the replenishment time. In that situation it is often necessary to hold a stock buffer in order to not lose the sale. 



See:[[replenishment time]], [[stock buffer]].
