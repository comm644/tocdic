## why change

<b>why change</b> - - The first question in the new change question sequence.  The question focuses on determining why a change to the system is necessary.



Usage: There are two bases for answering this question: 1. The strong belief that the system can perform significantly better and achieve higher levels of its performance measurements, or 2. The recognition of undesirable effects (UDEs) in the current environment that demonstrate either the gap between what is and what should be the environment, or the gap between where the organization is and where it should be with respect to its goal.  Typically, a gap analysis of where the organization is versus where it wants to be, or a listing of UDEs versus the desirable effect is used to help determine the answer to this question.
