## roadrunner work ethic

<b>roadrunner work ethic</b> - The work rules in the drum-buffer-rope or critical chain project management systems. The rules are: if there is work available start it immediately; if there is more than one work-order or task in queue choose the one with the highest system-priority; work at full speed without stopping until the work is completed; produce zero defects and pass the work on immediately; if there is no work available stay idle. 


Perspective: The name roadrunner comes from a popular cartoon character that had only one speed: the roadrunner would move at full speed until he reached his objective, then he came to a full stop and be ready to start again.
