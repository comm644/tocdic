## inherent simplicity

<b>inherent simplicity</b> -  - The concept that nature is simple and harmonious with itself.  


Usage: The concept of inherent simplicity in TOC is the basis for continually asking "why?" an effect occurs, surfacing the cause, validating the cause existence, asking why again, etc.  The structure of a current reality tree makes it clear that relatively few causes at lower levels in the tree result in many effects higher in the tree.
