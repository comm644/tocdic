<b>activation</b> -  - Putting a resource to work. 
Usage: TOC claims that activating a resource is not the same as utilizing it productively to achieve more of the goal.  If the work being done is in excess of what is needed to fully exploit the constraint or properly subordinate to it, then the result will be excess work-in-process inventory and/or excess finished goods. Perspective: In traditional management, non-constraints are frequently activated to levels above what is needed to exploit the constraint (over activation).  In TOC non-constraints are activated to level needed to fully exploit (utilize) the constraint.
needed to fully exploit (utilize) the constraint.
