## actively synchronized replenishment lead time

<b>actively synchronized replenishment lead time</b> -  - The longest cumulative unprotected lead time leg in a bill of material. 


Usage: Creating a stock buffer for a component in a bill of material shortens the lead time and protects the leg of the BOM that includes that component from variability upstream from that component. 



See:[[actively synchronized replenishment]].
