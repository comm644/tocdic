## task safety

<b>task safety</b> -  The difference between a task time estimate and the mean task time (the 50% task time estimate).



Usage: Many times a task estimate is twice or more the mean task time; this is the origin of the suggestion to cut estimated task times in half before using them in the critical chain schedule until resources and resource managers start giving challenging but achievable durations (i.e., approximately 50%  task time estimates).  

Caution: Some tasks have a static or fixed time and cannot be reduced significantly.
