## driving down

<b>driving down</b> - - Colloquial term used to describe the process of searching for the cause of one or more entities. 


Usage: Driving down is a discovery process that is often required in creating the current reality tree (using the original method, rather than the three-cloud approach) or in satisfying causality existence and entity existence reservations.  The term relates to the process of asking why an effect exists, determining and validating the cause and continually moving downward in creating the current reality tree until the lowest actionable root cause within the system's sphere of influence is identified.  

Syn.:[[diving down]], [[drilling down]].
