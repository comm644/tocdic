Perspective: In traditional manufacturing, the ideal is a balanced plant where all work center capacities are equal to demand (minimization of costs). In lean the ideal is a balanced plant where capacity is equal to daily demand.  In theory of constraints all work centers are structured to balance flow, not capacity.
