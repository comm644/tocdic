## load control

<b>load control</b> - 1. In a multi-project critical chain environment, the function of staggering projects so that a new project is not released until one exits the virtual drum or project system.  2. In a production environment (whether drum-buffer-rope or simplified drum-buffer-rope) load control ensures that new production is not released to the shop floor until an equivalent amount of work exits the constraint or shipping buffer.
