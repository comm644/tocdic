## critical chain for services

<b>critical chain for services</b> - (CC-S)  The TOC application for project management in services, particularly professional, scientific and technical services in multi-project environments.



Usage: Some services clients are time sensitive and are not willing to wait until resources would become available as scheduled using traditional critical chain project management.  Critical chain for services differs from critical chain in that it incorporates a resource bench, an approach that seeks to ensure resource availability by maintaining a group of skilled professionals for rapid assignment to any project.  The resource buffer has sufficient capacity to meet high demand for resources from multiple projects, even when that demand is unpredictable. Whenever the resource level drops below a specified size, replenishment for services automatically replenishes the skill.
