<b>negative feedback loop</b> -  - A set of logical cause-and-effect relationships that is connected in such a way that it produces a decreasing (negative) condition or behavior within a system.

Usage: A negative feedback loop is always a reinforcing feedback and is present in a system having problems that are getting worse, steadily deteriorating.  In general, feedback involves both the transmission and the return of information.  Since feedback loops exist in all real systems, it is important to actively identify and record them in any current reality tree, both for correct diagnosis and breaking the causality in a number of places to ensure improvement in the future reality tree.  Entities in a feedback loop are good candidates for leverage points.

 Illustration: If 10 We reduce the number of set-ups to increase efficiency then 20 We run larger batches and group like parts together.  If 20 We run larger batches and group like parts together then 30 We release materials that are not yet needed. And if 30 We release materials that are not yet needed then 40 We reduce the protective capacity of the work center.  Cause-and-effect loops back from 40 to 20 because reducing protective capacity reinforces running larger batches.
