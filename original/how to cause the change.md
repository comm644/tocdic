Usage: Typically, the prerequisite tree and the transition tree are the thinking processes that are used to help determine the plan and detailed actions required to respond to this query.  The objective in asking this question is to induce the proper people to invent solutions along the lines of those constructed in answering the preceding question in the change sequence - what to change to? Perspective: How to cause the change includes, but is not limited to, creating a plan for implementing change.  It also includes involving the appropriate people at the appropriate times in the other two steps of the change question sequence, as well as facilitating the process of those people creating the solution rather than dictating the required change(s). solution rather than dictating the required change(s).
