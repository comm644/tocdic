<b>undesirable effect</b> - (UDE) - A negative aspect of current reality, defined in relation to the organization's or system's goal or its necessary conditions;  a visible symptom of an  underlying root cause, core problem, or core conflict. 
Usage 1: Some characteristics of a well-articulated UDE include:  1.  It is a complaint about an ongoing problem that exists in reality and because of this problem, you 
cannot perform better.  
2.  It should be a complete sentence written in the present tense. 3.  It is a description of the state of the system, not an action. 4.  It is within your area of responsibility or influence. 5.  Something can be done about it. 6.  It must not blame someone.  7.  It must not be a speculated cause. 8.  It must not be a hidden solution to the problem.  9.  It must contain only one entity.  10.  It should not include its cause in its verbalization.  11.  It should be factual and not subjective. Usage 2: There are two types of UDEs. A "gap existence" UDE and a "difficulty to close the gap" UDE. As soon as we ask people to identify "what is the problem" or "what bothers you" we can get answers of both types.  There is a cause-and-effect relationship between these two types and it is therefore useful to get UDEs of both types to ensure a good analysis.  
For example, "Our project due date performance is 60%" is a gap existence UDE while "Resources are frequently not available" or "Priorities frequently change" are both "difficulty to close the gap" type UDEs. These are the "problems" stakeholders currently blame for their expectation gaps. Of course, we should ask the person doing the analysis to validate whether the second type actually exists in their reality, whether it exists to an extent that it can explain most if not all of the expectation gap. in their reality, whether it exists to an extent that it can explain most if not all of the expectation gap.
