<b>project completion (%)</b> - 1. An alternative measure of project progress.  The percentage by which the longest chain in a project has decreased:  
  Project completed (%)  =  100%
X
(1 - (longest chain remaining/total # of days on critical chain)) 
 
Usage: The percent project completed is more useful than critical chain completed (%) in cases where feeding chain progress lags behind the critical chain. Example: Suppose the initial critical chain duration is 40 days and the longest remaining chain in the project is 28 days long; the percent project completed is 30%. 
project is 28 days long; the percent project completed is 30%. 
project is 28 days long; the percent project completed is 30%.

A traditional project management measure of project progress:   Project completion (%)  =  100%  x       Amount of work completed on a project       .  Estimated total amount of work for the project  Usage: In the project network below]], [[the project has 15 tasks of one week each.  The shaded tasks have already been completed.  The un-shaded tasks have not been completed.  The bold outline indicates the tasks on the critical chain and the X indicates a resource that is stuck on a particularly difficult task.  The project completion percentage is calculated as (10 tasks completed)/(15 tasks in the project) = 67%.  In critical chain project management]], [[however]], [[the critical chain completed (%) would be calculated instead of the project completion percentage.  Because only two of the six tasks on the critical chain are complete]], [[the project is considered only 33% complete and there appears to be a significant probability that the project is going to be late. Illustration:  Caution: The use of the project completion percentage as a measure of project progress encourages resources that encounter problems or delays to move to other tasks on which progress can be made rather than solve the problem.  This results in multitasking]], [[extended project lead times and increased probability that the project will be late. See: project management measures]].
