<b>excess capacity</b> -  Capacity that is not used to either produce or protect throughput.
Illustration: In the diagram below, every resource in the production process has considerably more capacity than the market is demanding. The exact amount of excess capacity is unknown because it is not clear how much protective capacity is needed for each resource, but it is likely that workcenters A, B, C and E have some excess capacity. The limiting internal resource is D.
