<b>prerequisite</b> - In an evaporating cloud a state, condition or action (D or D') that is believed necessary to achieve its corresponding requirement (B or C).

Usage: A prerequisite or want exists because of some set of assumptions that may or may not be either known or valid.  Relative to an evaporating cloud, the existence of a prerequisite to satisfy a requirement is analogous to a want existing to satisfy a need.
