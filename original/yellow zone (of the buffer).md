<b>yellow zone (of the buffer)</b> -  The buffer management term for region II of the buffer.
Usage: Generally, parts are supposed to arrive, or a task should be completed, in some portion of the yellow zone. Yellow, a sign of warning, is used to refer to this region because any hole in region II should be checked to assess the potential for penetrating the red zone, and a plan of possible corrective action that may be taken if the hole penetrates the red zone should be developed. Perspective: TOC logistical solutions in production, project management and distribution/ replenishment use buffers to protect the constraint utilization and the customer due date from variation. These buffers are broken into three zones generally referred to as the green zone, the yellow zone and the red zone. These zones help set priorities in reacting to variation.
