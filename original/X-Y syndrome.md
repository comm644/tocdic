complete disappearance of TOC in spite of an incredibly successful implementation in one of the functional areas. 
Example: Implementing TOC in department/function "X" (often in operations by implementing DBR) has two effects: 1. it changes the people in department/function "X" so their thinking aligns with the throughput-world paradigm, and, 2. as department/function "X" goes through the five focusing steps, improvement is so significant that the constraint shifts outside, let's say to department/function "Y" (often sales or distribution or product development). "X" then puts pressure on "Y" to improve by adopting TOC but "Y" resists because they still operate in the cost-world paradigm. Usually "Y" wins the internal battle because the rest of the organization is still looking at business using the cost-world paradigm. The result is that TOC does not spread throughout the organization and may even disappear completely if the TOC "champion" in department/function "X" gets frustrated and leaves the company. Perspective: To avoid the X-Y syndrome, implement TOC holistically. Perspective: To avoid the X-Y syndrome, implement TOC holistically.
