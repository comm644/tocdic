<b>prerequisite-obstacle link</b> -  The building block for the prerequisite tree.  The first step in building the prerequisite tree is to identify obstacles  that are blocking or preventing a desirable system objective, condition, state of being, or desired action from occurring.  Second, an intermediate objective that overcomes each obstacle is identified.  These two entities comprise the prerequisite-obstacle link.

Usage: Obstacles are usually determined by builders of a prerequisite tree as they anticipate possible blockages or complications in implementing an injection to reach a desired effect or ambitious target.  Overcoming an obstacle requires the identification and achievement of an intermediate objective.  The prerequisite-obstacle links are placed on index cards or post-it notes and sequenced as to what intermediate objectives go first, second, in parallel, etc. starting from the present to the accomplishiment of the ultimate system objective, condition, etc.
