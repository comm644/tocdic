<b>order lead time</b> - The time from the consumption (sale in most cases) of an SKU until it is ordered for replenishment.  
Usage: During the order lead time the system continues to consume from the stock buffer.  Orders are generally placed daily (in some systems they may be placed even more frequently) and shipments are made as frequently as practical. If an item is used on Monday and the order to replenish the item is placed the following Friday, the order lead time is four days.  In a reorder point (ROP) system, replenishment orders are not issued until the stock level reaches or drops below the ROP.  In TOC distribution orders are typically placed daily, making the order lead time for all items one day. distribution orders are typically placed daily, making the order lead time for all items one day.
