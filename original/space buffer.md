<b>space buffer</b> - Physical space immediately after the constraint intended to accommodate output from the constraint when there is a stoppage downstream that would otherwise force the constraint to stop working.  
Usage: In contrast to other buffers where inventory is consumed or time is consumed, the consumption of a space buffer means that the space is filling up with inventory.  A condition of red means that the constraint space buffer is almost full and blockage of the constraint will occur unless space behind the constraint is freed so that the constraint can continue operating.
 constraint is freed so that the constraint can continue operating.
