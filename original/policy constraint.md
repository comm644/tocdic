<b>policy constraint</b> - A common misnomer. Bad policies are not the constraint, rather they hinder effective constraint management by inhibiting the ability to fully exploit or subordinate to the constraint. 
Example: Many manufacturers have a policy of building parts in an "economic order quantity", which results in larger than necessary production batches and higher than necessary work-in-process inventories. In addition, building in large batches can cause periodic starvation of the constraint.  The bad policy (of using EOQ) is not the constraint, rather the policy hinders the ability to fully exploit the constraint. Note: In the past policies were commonly referred to as a type of constraint. Note: In the past policies were commonly referred to as a type of constraint.
