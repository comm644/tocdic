<b>I-plant</b> - - A production environment in which materials generally flow through a direct sequence of operations.  The logical flow of materials resembles the letter I in the sense that there are few divergent points, as in a V-plant, and few convergent points, as in an A-plant. 
Examples: Transfer or assembly lines such as used to assemble lawn mowers.
