<b>Toyota Production System (</b> - TPS)A manufacturing philosophy originated by Toyota Motor Company that focuses on reducing setup times, batch sizes, lead times, and variations to reduce waste and increases flow and quality.
  
Perspective: Many of the Toyota Production System concepts are based on Henry Ford's assembly line concepts.  The Toyota Production System is the predecessor of the Just-in-time and lean manufacturing philosophies.  The Toyota Production System was highly successful at Toyota Motor Company and was based on getting inventories to the user just-in-time. When consultants and managers in the US brought the Toyota Production System concept and tools to its manufacturers they used the term: Just-in-time philosophy.  With the lack of success in implementing Just-in-time in the 1990's, many of its tools gave birth to the lean philosophy.  There is little difference among the concepts of the Toyota Production System, Just-in-time and lean manufacturing philosophies.
