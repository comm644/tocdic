<b>sales funnel management</b> -  - Management of the selling process of an organization. The number of prospects entering the sales process is limited with more attention directed at selling opportunities with prospects within the funnel.  A simplified drum-buffer-rope procedure is used where when one customer exits the sales process another prospect enters the sales process.  Perspective: The conversion rate from prospect to customer is much higher when more attention is paid to a limited number of clients.
