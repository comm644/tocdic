<b>order quantity</b> -  - The selling point should order the difference between its current on-hand inventory and the buffer target level adjusted for any adjustments in the buffer level minus in-transit inventory (inventory already ordered but not received). 
Example:  Suppose the buffer target is 300 units, current on-hand inventory (buffer status) is 225 and 20 units are in-transit.  Order quantity is therefore: 
 
 
 
Order quantity =
buffer target - (current on-hand inventory + in-transit inventory) 








 







 =
300 - (225 + 20)
 =
55 units
