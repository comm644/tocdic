<b>touch time</b> -  - The time actually spent working on a task. 
Usage: In traditional project organizations touch time is typically much less than the time allowed for a task or the elapsed taken to complete the task.  In implementing critical chain project management touch times or 50% task time estimates are typically used as a basis for determining task durations in critical chain networks.  Once resources become comfortable with the critical chain approach touch times frequently become the basis for estimating task duration.  In all situations buffer management should be used to reduce the variability of task times. 

Syn.:[[focused duration]].
