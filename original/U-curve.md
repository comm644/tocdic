<b>U-curve</b> -  - A convex curve depicting the relationship between the size of time buffers and the required level of management attention. 
Usage: When buffers are too small significant management attention is required.  If management doesn't have enough time to respond to orders penetrating the red zone of the buffer, capacity is lost due to starvation of the constraint or capacity-constrained resource.  As buffer size increases less management attention is required because fewer orders penetrate the red zone.  But as buffer size continues to increase, more orders are released and compete for resources causing work-in-process increases (and a decrease in management), therefore priorities are missed which causes lead times to increase. All of these require significant management attention.  The bottom of the U-curve (the valley) represents a wide range of buffer sizes over which little management attention is required.  This wide range provides safety when implementing theory of constraints.  Most organizations operate on the right side of the U-curve.
