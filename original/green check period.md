<b>green check period</b> -  - The length of time that an item can be in the green zone before deciding for a recommendation to reduce the buffer (i.e., the target level) for the item is made.  The recommended default length of the green check period is twice the replenishment time (which translates into three greens in a row). 
Usage:  If an item is continuously in the green zone of the buffer for twice the replenishment period, consideration should be given to reducing the buffer target (usually by one third) for the item.
