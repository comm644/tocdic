<b>material constraint</b> - Usually a misnomer. Material shortages are rarely the constraint, rather temporary material shortages hinder effective constraint management by inhibiting the ability to fully exploit or subordinate to the constraint. 
Perspective: Material does, at times, become difficult or impossible to get, such as the world-wide steel shortages in the early 21st century. In that situation, steel was the constraint for a period of time. But, in most cases, material shortages are temporary - or material is available from another supplier or at a higher price. So material shortage is rarely considered to be the constraint, rather it hinders effective constraint management by inhibiting the ability to fully exploit and/or subordinate to the constraint.
