<b>strategic constraint</b> -  The five focusing steps are not intended to be used as an infinite loop whereby an organization identifies and eliminates the current constraint over and over again. Rather, top management should determine where to move and hold the constraint with the intent of optimizing the organization's long-term ability to achieve its goal. Over time, of course, changes in markets, technology, etc. may cause organizational leaders to redefine the strategic constraint.  A strategic constraint is usually selected based on its scarcity i.e., a resource whose capacity is very expensive or difficult to elevate and thus there is a desire to grow to the state where this resource becomes the constraint. desire to grow to the state where this resource becomes the constraint.
