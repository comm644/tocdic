<b>generic cloud</b> - - 1. The generalized cloud created in the three-cloud approach.  By selecting three diverse problem areas, the generic cloud represents a synthesis of three relatively independent evaporating clouds and contains the core conflict that is responsible for many of the undesirable effects present in an organization or unit of study.
2. A general or basic conflict cloud between two people that represents various underlying day-to-day conflicts. 
Examples:  Generic clouds include: managing according to the cost-world versus the throughput- world, local versus global, an individual's well-being versus what is best for system, short-term versus long-term, and the lieutenant's cloud.

Illustration:  As shown below, a generalized conflict for a married couple might be described as "Live for today versus Save for tomorrow".  One of the day-to-day conflicts underlying this generic conflict might be, "Spend money on a fun-filled weekend versus do not spend money on a fun-filled weekend".  Another one might be, "Buy a boat versus do not buy a boat."
