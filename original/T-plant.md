# T-plant

<b>T-plant</b> - A production environment characterized by initial straight line flow followed by divergent final assembly points.  The logical network of material flow resembles the letter T in the sense that all materials go through similar processing until the final steps diverge to create a relatively large number of different end products assembled from common components.  


Perspective: In a T-plant the main problem is the stealing of common part/subassemblies across


products. 

Examples: Car assembly, and faucet manufacturing.
