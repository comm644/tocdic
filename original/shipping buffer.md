<b>shipping buffer</b> -  In drum-buffer-rope (DBR), one of the time buffers used to protect the shipping date of finished goods. 
Usage: In DBR, the shipping buffer is used to establish the order delivery date and is added to the constraint schedule for the order.  The release schedule for raw materials is based on the constraint schedule.  For parts that do not go through the constraint or assembly buffers, the shipping buffer is used to determine raw materials release and shipping date for the item.  Buffer management is used to identify the holes in the shipping buffer and the cause(s) of these holes as part of the process of ongoing improvement.  In simplified drum-buffer-rope, the shipping buffer is the only buffer used and is called the production buffer. Illustration:
