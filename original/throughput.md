<b>throughput</b> - (T) The rate at which the system generates "goal units".  
Usage: Because throughput is a rate, it is always expressed as goal units per unit of time (e.g., hour, day, month or year) or unit of product.  If the goal units are money, throughput will be an amount of money per time period or per unit of product.  In the case of throughput per time period, throughput is calculated as (revenues received for the period minus totally variable costs) divided by the chosen time period.  In the case of throughput per unit of product, throughput is calculated as the selling price of the product minus totally variable costs per unit.
Example: Suppose a company produces only one product, and it sells for $100 and has totally variable costs of $35 per unit. If, in a week, the company produces 500 units but only sells 450, throughput would be $29,250 per week ((100-35) x 450). It should be noted that product produced but not sold does not generate throughput, it increases inventory. does not generate throughput, it increases inventory.
