<b>drum schedule</b> - The detailed work schedule for operations that sets the pace for the entire system.  
Usage: The drum schedule must be based on market demand and the finite capacity of the system constraint. In operations, the drum schedule combined with the rope mechanism helps limit work-in- process inventory which, in turn, reduces lead time and increases system performance. 
In a multi-project environment using critical chain project management the drum schedule 
determines the planned start and estimated completion dates of projects using the drum resources and therefore sets the pace and determines how many projects a system can complete within a specified time period. time period.
