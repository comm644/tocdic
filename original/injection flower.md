<b>injection flower</b> - -A structured graphic representation of the areas to be learned, checked and developed by a TOC implementer to ensure a successful implementation of an injection.  The upper part of the injection flower contains the solution design ("What" - the relevant knowledge for the injection), the lower part presents mechanics ("How" - the practicalities of the injection describing the way the injection is integrated into the reality as well as how to make it happen).  
Usage: For every injection the implementation team has to learn its essence and structure, and check that the injection addresses the relevant undesirable effects, brings about the desirable effects, and does not cause any significant negative branch reservations.  For every injection the team builds the implementation plan and develops the procedures.  
The role of the TOC leader is to encourage and support the implementation team in doing this work.
