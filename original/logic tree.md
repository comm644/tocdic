Usage: Logic trees can be based on either sufficiency-based logic (e.g., current reality tree) or necessity-based logic (e.g., prerequisite tree). Small logic trees that use sufficiency-based logic are sometimes referred to as logic branches or logic twigs, especially when excerpted from a larger sufficiency-based logic tree.
