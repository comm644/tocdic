<b>wandering bottleneck</b> -  An undesirable effect in which the bottleneck moves relatively frequently from one resource to another. 
Usage: "Interactive constraints" is a broader term than "wandering bottleneck".  Constraints include such things as scarce resources in a production environment, critical chains in a project environment, the market for a given product, etc. while bottlenecks describe scarce resources in a production environment.  While studying the project management environment for a client, Dr. Goldratt recognized that the critical chain in a project was the constraint to finishing the project.  Shortly thereafter he changed the name of the body of knowledge he created to the "Theory of Constraints".
