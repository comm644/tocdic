<b>local optimum</b> -  The maximization or minimization of a measure of a part of a system or organization.  
Example:In traditional cost accounting, actions taken to improve local performance at a work center or in a specific function are viewed as having global impact on performance.  Conversely, in TOC actions to improve local performance are seen as not necessarily improving global performance.
