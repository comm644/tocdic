<b>inner dilemma cloud</b> -  - An evaporating cloud used on a standalone basis (i.e., not as part of a complete thinking processes analysis) when a person feels pressure to make a decision with which he or she does not feel comfortable and the decision maker's preference has not yet been disclosed, i.e., the conflict is internal. 
Illustration: A manager has been told by her supervisor to fire a subordinate.  The manager is uncomfortable with the decision because the subordinate performs his job well and the manager believes her supervisor's opinion is based on factors not related to the subordinate's job performance.
