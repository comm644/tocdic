It is a humbling experience to write or edit a dictionary.  You immediately find out what you don't know and how much of what you do know is wrong.  In addition, the definitions of terms are constantly changing as we continually develop and define our body of knowledge.  We have learned to accept Dr. Goldratt's 4th pillar of TOC:  "never say I know."  From that perspective this has been a rewarding experience.

The second edition of the TOCICO Dictionary could not have been completed without the hard work of a number of volunteer reviewers and term submitters.  We sorted the dictionary terms into files based on the certification exams and a miscellaneous category.  Some files were well over 100 terms with sometimes two or three definitions for a term and figures supporting the definitions.  The review process may have required that a file be reviewed three times in full, and a few stubborn terms required significant back and forth correspondence with a number of individuals.

Alan Barnard, John Blackstone, Oded Cohen, Jelena Fedurko, Rob Newbold, John Schleier, Eli Schragenheim, and Danny Walsh, have the distinction of reviewing and discussing terms from two or more of the six files a number of times.  We had many heated discussions with these individuals.  As a policy, we always took the opposite position on any definition so that we could get the best arguments from our reviewers.  They were worthy adversaries.  Many thanks go to each of them; we are in awe of your willingness to help in this massive project.

Charlene Budd, Bill Dettmer, Lisa Ferguson, Ted Hutchin, Vicky Mabin, Carol Ptak, Chad Smith, Shri Srikanth, John Thompson, and Kevin Watson comprise our second group of reviewers and submitters.  These individuals reviewed at least one file of terms; again in some cases they reviewed the file two or three times and discussed the dwindling number of terms until we reconciled the last one. Our thanks go to you.

Others individuals submitted terms or reviewed segments of files where they possessed particular expertise.  These individuals included Rick Denison, Alex Klarman, Lisa Lang, Lars Peterson, John Ricketts, Rick Stanton, Kathy Suerken, and Julie Wright.  Our thanks go to you.
  
Special thanks go to Dr. Eli Goldratt and Wendy Maxwell for providing the currently correct answer for some really tough questions and their directions on where to find a discussion of an item. The Goldratt Marketing Group allowed access to a number of videos for our review.
 
Tim Sullivan, one of the 1st edition editors, was extremely helpful in giving us the ground rules used for the first edition so we did not have to start from scratch.  And finally Carol Ptak as executive director of TOCICO is amazing.  She had the answers we needed and responded immediately to our questions and concerns.

We could not have completed this project without the continued support of our wives and families.

We (Jim Cox and Lynn Boyd) are responsible for any errors that might appear in this volume.  Please feel free to contact Lynn if you have any questions or concerns.
