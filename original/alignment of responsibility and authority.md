# alignment of responsibility and authority

<b>alignment of responsibility and authority</b> -  - This well-known organizational behavior principle is the primary injection to the lieutenant's evaporating cloud, or conflict cloud, in the management of human behavior.  The template for the lieutenant's cloud is provided below.  The injection to the lieutenant's cloud is the proper alignment of responsibility and authority.  To construct the lieutenant's cloud for an alignment conflict answer the questions in each box.



 


Illustration:  In this story line, the company has experienced problems in the past when multiple people inside the company speak directly to the customer.  A policy was established that only the account manager can speak with the customer.  It happened, however, that the account manager was not available when the shipping manager needed to ask the customer a question about an order that needed to ship immediately or it would be late.  The shipping manager (the "lieutenant") was responsible to ship the order on time but lacked the authority to contact the customer in order to get the information needed to fulfill his/her responsibility.  As shown in the cloud below, the injection to evaporate this cloud is giving the lieutenant the authority to contact the customer when it has a direct impact on his or her ability to fulfill the responsibility of shipping on time.
