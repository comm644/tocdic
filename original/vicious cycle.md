Example: A situation in which projects are late and the organization releases new projects earlier and earlier in hopes of completing them by the due date.  As the number of projects in execution increases, competition for resources increases, resulting in projects being completed later and later.  The late completions result in more pressure to release subsequent projects even earlier.
