<b>subordinate</b> -  The key word in the third of the five focusing steps: subordinate everything else to the above decision. Subordination is vital to achieve full exploitation of the constraint. Subordination has two major components: 1. all non-constraint resources must be managed to ensure that the constraint always has exactly what it needs when it needs it; and, 2. all non-constraint resources are not allowed to process work beyond what is required for the constraint. 
Example: In the case of an internal resource constraint, non-bottleneck resources should ignore such things as local efficiency and run smaller batches in order to ensure that the constraint does not starve. things as local efficiency and run smaller batches in order to ensure that the constraint does not starve.
