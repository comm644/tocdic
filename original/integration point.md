<b>integration point</b> - In critical chain project management,the task where major paths in a project converge.  
Usage: The integration point is usually near the end of a project where several different paths converge (e.g., subprograms in a large program, assemblies for an aircraft) to produce the finished product.  A feeding buffer is inserted at integration points (similar to any convergent point) on the critical chain to protect it from disruptions on the non-critical-chain paths.  An integration point may be selected as the virtual drum and then can be used for scheduling projects and as the release mechanism for new projects in a multi-project environment: new projects are released for execution when a project exits the integration point.  Managing the integration point is critical to achieving high due date performance and increased flow of projects.
performance and increased flow of projects.
