Usage: TDD considers the monetary value of the things a link is committed to deliver but doesn't, and the number of days by which the link misses the commitment. The system should strive for zero throughput-dollar-days.  TDD is the summation of the commitments not delivered on time during the chosen time period. The TDD value of individual missed commitments is calculated by multiplying the dollar value of the end product times the number of days the commitment is/was overdue. The unit of measure "dollar-days" is neither monetary nor time based. Attempts to compare dollar-days to other monetary measures are invalid. TDDs can be compared only to other TDD levels. Example: Suppose in the month of January a certain supplier was late delivering two orders. The first was 10 units of Part #1234 each having $45 of throughput; the order was delivered two days late. The second late order was for five units of Part #562 each having $70 of throughput; that order was eight days late. The TDD for that supplier for January was 3700. ((10 x 45 x 2) + (5 x 70 x 8)). Caution: Great care is needed when using TDD to evaluate a local area as it might cause such areas to minimize TDDs rather than take more appropriate actions (for example, according to buffer management requirements). management requirements).
