<b>planned load</b> -  - The total load on a resource of all the firm orders that have to be delivered within a certain horizon of time.  The time horizon used to determine the planned load is generally longer than the production buffer by at least a factor of two.  The planned load is used extensively in simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR) to ensure smooth flow and to make due date commitments that can be reliably achieved. 
Usage: Planned load is used to validate that a relatively loaded resource has enough capacity to meet the market requirements.  It is also used to quote safe delivery dates by means of adding half of the time buffer to the current front of the planned-load to denote a "safe-date" to promise delivery.  The release time for the just-received order is the front of the planned-load minus half of the time buffer.
