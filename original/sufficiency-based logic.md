<b>sufficiency-based logic</b> - - A type of cause-and-effect reasoning in which the existence of one or more causes leads unavoidably to the existence of the effect. 
Usage: The thinking processes diagrams that use this type of "ifâ¦thenâ¦" (cause and effect) logic are the current reality tree, future reality tree, negative branch reservation, transition tree, and strategy and tactic tree. Illustration 1: Sufficiency-based logic diagrams are read beginning with the entity at the beginning of the arrow. The following logic diagram is verbalized: If 10 I default on a loan then 20 My credit rating goes down.
  
 
Illustration 2: Sometimes one cause is not sufficient to explain the existence of the observed effect. In such cases two or more causes are diagramed and linked with a logical 'and' connector (or ellipse).  The following logic diagram is verbalized: If 10 I turn the ignition key to my car and 20 My car has a dead battery then 30 My car won't start.
