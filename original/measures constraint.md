<b>measures constraint</b> -  A common misnomer. Bad measures are not the constraint. Rather, bad measures hinder effective constraint management by inhibiting the ability to fully exploit or subordinate to the constraint. 
Usage: In the past measurements were commonly referred to as a type of constraint. Example: Measuring efficiency at all resources drives overproduction at non-bottleneck resources and leads to starvation of the bottleneck. The efficiency measures are not the constraint, they are not what should be exploited and subordinated to; rather, they are blocking the system's ability to exploit and subordinate properly to the constraint. subordinate properly to the constraint.
