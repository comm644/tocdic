<b>technology questions</b> -  - A set of six questions used to evaluate the potential and impact of new technology:  1.  What is the power of the new technology? 2.  What current limitation or barrier does the new technology reduce or eliminate? 3.  What usage rules, patterns and behaviors exist today that consider the limitation? 4.  What rules, patterns and behaviors need to be changed to realize the benefits of the new technology? 5.  What is the application of the new technology that will enable the above change without causing 
resistance? 
6.  How can the technology be used to build, capitalize and sustain the business?  
Usage: The ideas stemming from answering the six technology questions can help focus development of the product's features and the marketing approach and help developers of the new technology reach a better understanding of the required match between the new technology and the way the user should use the technology. Example:  electronic book reader
1.  The ability to store and display books in electronic format on a screen that is similar to the page 
format in a book, coupled with full navigation and the ability to download additional books.

2.  Two different limitations overcome by current book readers.  One limitation is large space 
requirement for books at home.  The second limitation is the difficulty of carrying a wide choice of books when traveling or in another location.  
3.  The current "solutions" to the limitations are books in "pocket" or paperback format that makes it 
easier to carry or store several books.  The general limitations force a process of choosing books based on recommendations and then feeling compelled to finish reading even when the book is not particularly interesting. 
4.  The new rules are to purchase and store many books on the reader and carrying the reader with us 
any place we go.  In some cases, one can download one or a few chapters to read prior to buying the electronic book.

5.  The book reader itself should be very light, not easily breakable and fit easily into a briefcase.  The 
price of the books should be low enough to be able to create a whole library.  Reading should be possible even in bright sunlight.

6.  The big problem, which still exists, is to get people to try it to overcome the resistance to reading 
from a screen.  Making the book reader itself very affordable, thereby making it possible for more people to try it, is a move that might be worthwhile.  Of course, managing a fast growing inventory of books in electronic format is a must.
