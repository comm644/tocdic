<b>red curve - green curve</b> - - 1. A set of curves representing two mindsets, that of "diminishing returns" (the green curve) versus the mindset of "increasing returns" (the red curve) with respect to an organization achieving its goal.  2. More recently, the green curve has been used to represent the goal of stability while the red curve has come to represent the goal of growth.  
Illustration 1: 
 Perspective 1: The green curve represents a local implementation effort where an area such as production is the organization constraint; the constraining resource is identified and exploited effectively.  The constraint then moves to another function and action is taken.  The improved area now has more capacity than needed.  Eventually cost-world thinking is applied and layoffs ensue in the production area, thus killing the TOC implementation and the organizational performance decreases.  The red curve represents a holistic implementation in which the five focusing steps are used to ensure that the organization's constraint is what it should be from a strategic point of view. Illustration 2: 
 Perspective 2:  It is current thought that an organization needs both stability (the green curve) and growth (the red curve).  Companies should strive to ensure that their financial performance (red curve) continues to grow while ensuring that the financial growth doesn't jeopardize company stability. The strategy and tactics tree provides guidance for achieving both necessary conditions.
