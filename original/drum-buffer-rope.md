<b>drum-buffer-rope</b> - (DBR) - The TOC method for scheduling and managing operations when there is an internal resource constraint. 
Usage: DBR uses the following: 1. the drum, generally the constraint or capacity-constrained resource (CCR), which processes work in a specific sequence based on the customer requested due date and the finite capacity of the resource; 2. time buffers which protect the constraint and shipping schedule from variability; and, 3. a rope mechanism to choke the release of raw materials to match consumption at the constraint. Simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR) challenges the need to schedule the constraint and to have a CCR buffer to protect the schedule.  Instead S-DBR monitors the planned load to ensure that the CCR has adequate capacity to handle all the demand to be delivered by the required due dates.  Both DBR and S-DBR use buffer management to continuously maintain flow through the production process and improve a production environment. process and improve a production environment.
