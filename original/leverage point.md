<b>leverage point</b> - -A point, either physical or logical, where a specific action would provide significant system improvement.

Usage: A constraint is the leverage point in a physical flow of goal units in a system.  The core problem is the leverage point in the cause-and-effect analysis of how to better exploit or elevate the system constraint.  Example: An entity in a positive feedback loop in a future reality tree is a leverage point, since if change can be initiated here it will lead to continuing improvement in results.  change can be initiated here it will lead to continuing improvement in results.
