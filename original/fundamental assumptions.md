<b>fundamental assumptions</b> -  (of TOC) -Basic beliefs thought to generally apply to all social systems: 1. People are good ... but we all have "bad" assumptions that block us from seeing and unlocking inherent 
potential within ourselves, others and the organizations we work in. 
2. Every conflict can be removed ...if we can find and challenge the erroneous assumption(s) causing the 
conflict. 
3. Every situation (or system), no matter how complex it initially appears to be, is exceedingly simple ...if 
we can find the one or few high leverage points, the inherent simplicity in any situation or system. 
4. Every situation can be substantially improved ...if we can just think clearly in all situations we 
encounter using these assumptions. Usage: In "The Choice", Dr Eli Goldratt states that once someone makes the choice to believe and act according to these four assumptions, then he or she can reach a full life and that not even the sky is the limit.   The four fundamental assumptions of TOC expand on the two fundamental assumptions of the hard sciences as TOC is dealing with social systems that involve people. The two fundamental assumptions of the hard sciences are captured in Sir Isaac Newton's quote:  "<i><b>Natura valde simplex est et sibi <br/>consona</b></i>" which means "Nature is exceedingly simple and harmonious with itself".  Newton's quote is

claimed to capture the two fundamental beliefs of the hard sciences: the assumption that the universe (and all other complex systems) are governed by inherent simplicity; and that within such systems there is inherent harmony (there cannot be any contradictions within the governing rules). 
With his "Theory of Constraints", Dr. Eli Goldratt introduced these two fundamental beliefs of the "hard sciences" and, as importantly, the thinking processes and methods of a scientist to the world of analyzing, improving and managing organizations or social systems. He expanded these two base assumptions with two further assumptions to incorporate important dynamics within social systems: "People are good" and "Every situation can be substantially improved".
