<b>most penetrating chain</b> - The chain of work that, although not on the original critical chain, currently extends farther into the project buffer than any other chain of work. The most penetrating chain includes the non-critical chain work and the remaining work on the critical chain once the chain intersects the original critical chain. 
Usage: When a feeding chain penetrates the original critical chain the feeding chain becomes the most penetrating chain and therefore the new critical chain. penetrating chain and therefore the new critical chain.
