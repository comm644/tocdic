# capacity-constrained resource (CCR)

<b>capacity-constrained resource (CCR)</b> -  - Any resource that, if its capacity is not carefully managed, is likely to compromise the throughput of the organization. 


Illustration: In the example shown below the production line has five resources (A through E) with the capacities shown.  Resource D experiences enough variation in output that if it is not carefully managed, output will drop below demand and throughput of the system will go down; therefore "D" is a capacity-constrained resource.
