<b>traditional project management</b> - A philosophy of managing a project organization that focuses on local optimization (i.e., maximizing resource utilization) to achieve maximum short-term organizational profits. Multi-tasking within and across projects is rampant and extends both task times and project times, leading to the release of new projects into the system in hopes of starting projects early enough that they will be completed on time.  Resources and resource managers add safety to their task time estimates to ensure on-time task completion as they are responsible for achieving their task time estimates.
