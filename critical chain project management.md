## critical chain project management

<b>critical chain project management</b> - (CCPM)The TOC solution for planning, scheduling, and managing performance in a project environment.  


Usage: CCPM is applied in two very different environments: single-project and multi-project.  In multi-project environments resources are shared across several different projects concurrently. 
In a single-project environment the critical chain project management solution includes the  following: 
1. removal of existing behaviors that are harmful to the goal of the project, such as bad multitasking, the student syndrome and Parkinson's Law (work expanding to fill the available time); 
2. a plan, or project network, that includes all task and resource dependencies as well as time estimates with safety removed; 
3. a schedule showing the critical chain and the buffers; 
4. implementation of new behaviors critical to streamlining flow such as the relay runner work ethic and frequent reporting of work remaining; and 
5. expediting and improvement activities based on buffer management. 


In a multi-project environment the critical chain project management solution has the elements of the single-project environment and in addition has a mechanism for staggering the release of projects.  This release mechanism can be either physical, i.e., a "drum" resource, or a policy stating that, for example, no more than six projects can be in flow at any time.  As each project's tasks are completed by the drum resource another comparable project is released to execution.  As synchronization within and across projects based on management of the release mechanism improves, the rate of project completion increases significantly.  Other names for the drum resource are virtual drum, strategic resource, and integration point.

In both project environments there is an additional element of project control and visibility -  buffer management. Critical chain project management requires frequent updates of estimated time required to complete in-progress tasks. This information is used to update the status of the various buffers, which in turn provides the information needed to know when and where corrective action is necessary.
