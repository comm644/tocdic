## task

<b>task</b> -  - An activity or series of activities, performed by one or more resources, represented as a single entity in a critical chain network.



Usage:  When networks have thousands of activities, the project manager is operating within the noise of the task distributions.  Some managers work with the large network while others use a rule of thumb to reduce its size.  A rule of thumb that many project managers use is that no network should exceed 300 tasks; when a network exceeds this limit, a number of activities or a sub-network may be called a task in the larger network. Many times a task is defined by a deliverable which then becomes the starting point for the next task.
