<b>causality existence reservation</b> - - A Level II reservation in the categories of legitimate reservation that is used to question whether or not the proposed causal relationship between two entities really exists.

Usage: Causality is differentiated from correlation (the degree to which two or more attributes or measurements on the same group of elements show a tendency to vary together) by the verifiability of a causal relationship. Illustration 1: Examining the following logic diagram, a scrutinizer might ask: "How does gambling produce financial security?" 
 Illustration 2: Examining the following logic diagram, a scrutinizer might ask: "How does being certified in a field or discipline assure that you know everything about the subject?"
