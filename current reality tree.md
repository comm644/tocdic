## current reality tree

<b>current reality tree</b> - (CRT) - A thinking processes sufficiency-based logic diagram that facilitates answering the question (from the change question sequence): "what to change?" by illustrating the cause and effect relationships between the core problem and the undesirable effects (UDEs) in a system. 


Usage: The CRT uses "if.., then..." logic to present unbroken chains of cause-and-effect relationships from the core problem or core conflict upward to the undesirable effects.  It also presents sequences of entities which depict system-based policies leading to measurements, which in turn, are causing undesirable behaviors to occur.

The CRT is often used when: 1. it is not clear how to implement one or more of the five focusing 
steps or, 2. the system improvement team has trouble obtaining managerial buy-in of proposed changes.  By understanding why the UDEs exist, the system improvement team is able to design a set of interventions or injections to eliminate the core problem, and hence, the majority of the most significant undesirable effects. 
There are two approaches to developing a current reality tree - the traditional approach, which starts 
with a list of UDEs and connects them using cause and effect logic, and the three-cloud approach, which starts with three evaporating clouds from which is developed a generic cloud that becomes the basis for the CRT.
