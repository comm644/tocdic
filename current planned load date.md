## current planned load date

<b>current planned load date</b> -  - In simplified drum-buffer-rope in make-to-order and make-to-availability environments, the date on which the CCR is expected to complete processing all currently known orders. This is the point in time that a new order can be run on the CCR and from which material release and completion dates are calculated.



Usage: One-half of the production time buffer is added to the current planned load date to determine a safe date for committing to the customer.  In other words, the current planned load date should normally fall at about the middle of the production time buffer.  Conversely, one-half the production time buffer is subtracted from the current planned load date to determine the raw materials release date.
