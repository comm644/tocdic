## bill of material decoupling

<b>bill of material decoupling</b> -   The process of inserting stock buffers at strategic points in the aggregate bill of material for component parts that have the potential for reducing the lead time of parent items to the market. 


Usage: The decoupling effect is for materials planning purpose only - the BOM still describes how products are built.
