## Archimedes lever point

<b>Archimedes lever point</b> -  - Archimedes stated: "Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough and I shall move the earth."  This principle is applied in TOC to describe a system composed of many components.  A change to only one or a very few components causes significant change in the system performance with respect to its goal. The TOC processes of ongoing improvement focus on identifying and managing the leverage point(s) in a system.
