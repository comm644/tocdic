## negative branch reservation process

<b>negative branch reservation process</b> -  A method that uses sufficiency logic to show that implementing a proposed injection may lead to one or more new undesirable effects. 


Usage: The negative branch reservation process involves the creation of one or more future reality branches with the purpose surfacing and eliminating new UDEs.


Illustration: The figure on the left shows the negative branch.  Using if-then logic the developer tries to eliminate the undesirable effect by developing additional supporting injections.  The figure on the right shows the ideal state with only desirable effects.
