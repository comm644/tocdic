## make-to-availability

<b>make-to-availability</b> - (MTA)A combination of a marketing message of commitment to the availability of particular items at a particular location with the required production policies for achieving it.



Usage: Make-to-availability fits a consumption-driven production environment (supplying according to consumption) used to respond immediately and reliably to demand where the customer tolerance time is less than the production lead time.  Inventories are maintained in the supply chain to ensure 100% availability with minimum stock.  Customer orders are composed mainly of very small quantities of known (repeat) items and the commitment to the market has to include the maximum immediate demand for a single order, enabling reduced inventories and increasing inventory turns.


Illustration.  Stock buffers of finished goods inventory are usually kept at a central or plant warehouse to aggregate orders from downstream links and serve as a basis for production scheduling of manufacturing facilities.  The amount consumed from the centralized stock buffers establishes the production quantities and the buffer status determines the priorities for manufacturing. Simplified drum-buffer-rope for planning and buffer management to maintain priorities in execution are used.  Downstream supply chain links (wholesalers, distributors, and retailers) maintain small inventories of each SKU, order daily and replenish frequently from an upstream centralized manufacturing facility (preceding link in each chain).  The manufacturing facility then replenishes its centralized inventory buffer by placing production orders. The centralized buffer acts as the strategic control point managing both supply and demand across the supply chain.  Raw materials buffers are generally kept at the manufacturing facility to reduce supplier lead times with frequent replenishments from suppliers.
