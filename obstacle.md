## obstacle

<b>obstacle</b> -  Something that blocks or prevents a desirable system condition, state of being, or desired action from occurring. 


Usage: Obstacles are usually determined by builders of a prerequisite tree as they anticipate possible blockages or complications in implementing an injection to reach a desired effect or ambitious target.  Overcoming an obstacle requires the identification and achievement of an intermediate objective.
