## convergent point

<b>convergent point</b> - 1. In production, an operation in a production process in which multiple materials, 
 parts or components are combined into a single component. An assembly operation is an example of a convergent point. 


Usage: Convergent points are common in an A-plant and are usually used as control points.




See:[[A-plant]], [[control points.  2. In projects]], [[a task where two or more proceeding paths must be completed prior to the succeeding task starting. 

Usage: When a noncritical path merges with the critical chain a feeding buffer is inserted on the noncritical path where it converges with the critical chain.  This buffer reduces the likelihood that the noncritical path may become the critical chain.See: feeding buffer]], [[integration point]].
