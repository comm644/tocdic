## logic tree

<b>logic tree</b> -  A graphical representation of cause-and-effect relationships consisting of several entities connected by arrows and using either sufficiency- or necessity-based logic.





Usage: Logic trees can be based on either sufficiency-based logic (e.g., current reality tree) or necessity-based logic (e.g., prerequisite tree). Small logic trees that use sufficiency-based logic are sometimes referred to as logic branches or logic twigs, especially when excerpted from a larger sufficiency-based logic tree.


Syn.:[[tree diagram]].
