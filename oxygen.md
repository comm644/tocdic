## oxygen

<b>oxygen</b> - - An assumption that is usually not documented on a thinking processes sufficiency-based diagram because it is known by all to exist and accepted as an element of reality everywhere.



Illustration:  The following logic diagram is verbalized: If 60 I have fuel and 70 I have a heat source then 90 I can create a fire.  Oxygen must also be present, but oxygen is everywhere we are, so we usually assume oxygen is available and it is not necessary to document it on our sufficiency-based logic diagram.
