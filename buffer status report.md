## buffer status report

<b>buffer status report</b> - A recurring report that provides a snapshot of the status of work in a given environment: 1. each production work order in a make-to-order drum-buffer-rope or simplified drum-buffer-rope environment, 2. each stock-keeping unit in a make-to-availability environment, and 3. each project or all projects in a project management environment. 


Usage: 1. In a make-to-order environment using drum-buffer-rope, the buffer status report shows the current status of each production order in the constraint, assembly, and shipping buffers.  2. In a make-to-availability environment, the buffer status report describes the status of buffers of raw material and work-in-process inventories, and also describes the status of finished goods in the central warehouse for the manufacturer.  This information is used to determine priorities. 3. In a distribution environment, the buffer status report provides the current status for all stock buffers. 4. In critical chain project management, the buffer status report provides the current status of the resource, feeding and project completion buffers for each project.  In constructing the buffer status report, the key question is "How much time remains until a resource completes its current task?  This information is used to determine buffer penetration at control points in the project and system.
