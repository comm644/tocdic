## resource buffer

<b>resource buffer</b> -  A warning mechanism used in single project environments to ensure that resources working on a critical chain task are available when needed. 


Usage: A resource buffer is sized based on the level of warning that is needed in the environment. The resource buffer not only prevents delays in the critical chain that would occur if a resource were not available when needed, it improves the chances of taking advantages of early finishes. Resource buffers do not add time to the project lead time. 

Syn.:[[resource alert]].
