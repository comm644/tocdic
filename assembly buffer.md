<b>assembly buffer</b> - - A time buffer used in an operations environment to ensure that parts that do not flow through a constraint resource, but are assembled with parts that do, are released early enough so that the probability is very high that the constraint parts will continue to flow without delay once they arrive at the assembly operation. 
Usage: The assembly buffer is not as commonly used as the constraint and shipping buffers. If variation affecting parts not going through the constraint, capacity-constrained resource or drum resource degrades system performance, an assembly buffer should be used. This type of buffer is not used in simplified DBR. used in simplified DBR.
