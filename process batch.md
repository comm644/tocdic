## process batch

<b>process batch</b> -  The quantity or volume of output that is to be completed at a workstation before switching to a different type of work or changing an equipment set-up. 


Usage: In batch and queue environments production lead time can often be shortened significantly by setting the transfer batch size smaller than the process batch. 



See:[[production lead time]], [[transfer batch]].
