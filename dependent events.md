## dependent events

<b>dependent events</b> - - A series of events in which each event requires that certain preceding event(s) take place before it can be completed. 


Usage: TOC claims that in systems with statistical fluctuations and dependent events operations are best managed using the concepts of drum-buffer-rope or critical chain project management. Example: A dine-in restaurant is a system of dependent events: the customer does not pay for the meal before the meal is eaten; cannot eat before the food is served; the meal cannot be served before the order is placed; and the order is not placed before the customers are seated at a table. Each event in the system is dependent on the preceding event.
