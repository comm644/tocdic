## over activation

<b>over activation</b> -  Activating a resource more than is required to keep pace with the constraint under normal circumstances, or, after a system disturbance, more than is required to rebuild the bank of materials in front of the constraint. 


Example: If a resource that has a capacity of 7 hours a shift and normally has to produce 5.5 hours of output to keep up with the constraint, producing more than the required 5.5 hours of output is usually over activation. The exception is when a disruption has occurred and more than 5.5 hours of output are required to rebuild the bank of materials in a downstream buffer.
