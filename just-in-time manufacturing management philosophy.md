## just-in-time manufacturing management philosophy

<b>just-in-time manufacturing management philosophy</b> - The success or the Toyota Production System (TPS).  When the TPS was introduced into the United States it was renamed just-in-time manufacturing.  The focus was on making just the right quantity of an item at just the right time and having it at the right place, hence the name just-in-time was coined.  After numerous failures at implementing just-in-time in the US many of the JIT tools were recast into a new management philosophy called lean which focused on the elimination of waste, simplification of operations and the improvement of flow.
