## multitasking

<b>multitasking</b> -  Stopping work on a task before it is completed in order to start work on another task. 


Usage: Multitasking itself is neither bad nor good. Bad multitasking occurs when switching tasks does not help any project finish earlier. 

Example: In a multi-project environment it is common for resources to be required to switch between tasks on various projects (or within the same project) in order to show progress. Such multitasking usually extends the duration of all projects and, therefore, is bad multitasking. If, however, a resource is forced to stop a task on one project in order to complete a task that is delaying the critical chain or the most penetrating chain on another project, thereby helping that project to finish earlier, it is usually considered good multitasking.
