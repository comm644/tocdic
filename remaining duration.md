## remaining duration

<b>remaining duration</b> - In critical chain project management, a measure reported regularly by resources and resource managers indicating the estimated time remaining until the completion of a task.  


Usage: The remaining task duration is used to measure task progress and determining project status and progress.  While the remaining duration is collected and reviewed on each task, it becomes significant only when buffer penetration (feeder and, more importantly, project buffer) is significant.
