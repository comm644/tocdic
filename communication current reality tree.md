<b>communication current reality tree</b> - (CCRT) A simplified or abridged version of the current reality tree developed to obtain buy-in from organizational personnel including employees, management, and board members.

Usage:  The CCRT connects the core conflict cloud at the base of the logic tree with the undesirable effects (UDEs) associated with the appropriate side of the conflict.  This design facilitates communication with management because the CCRT reduces the likelihood of "finger pointing" which leads to defensive postures that block progress toward real solutions.  The CCRT accomplishes this by clearly showing that the UDEs result from a systemic conflict and not from the irrational behavior of individuals. behavior of individuals.
