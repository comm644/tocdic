## predicted undesirable effect

<b>predicted undesirable effect</b> - (PUDE) - An undesirable effect that is expected to result from implementation of an injection or from moving to the other side of a conflict. 


Usage: One of the main purposes of the future reality tree is to identify predicted undesirable effects and additional injections necessary to prevent them from occurring.  The negative branch reservation process is used to surface the causal linkages to predicted and unpredicted undesirable effects.
