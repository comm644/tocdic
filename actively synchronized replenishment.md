## actively synchronized replenishment

<b>actively synchronized replenishment</b> - (ASR)- A set of demand-driven planning and execution techniques for inventory positioning used within material and distribution replenishment systems to strategically compress lead time and protect and/or increase service levels with less working capital.  


Perspective: ASR is the integration of a pull distribution system with a demand driven material requirements planning system.  In contrast, traditional material and distribution requirement planning systems forecast demand for finished products and push inventories through the logistics system based on these forecasts.
