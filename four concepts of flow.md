## four concepts of flow

<b>four concepts of flow</b> - - Production concepts underlying Ford's assembly line and Ohno's Toyota Production System are:  1. Improving flow (or equivalently lead time) is a primary objective of operations. 2. This primary objective should be translated into a practical mechanism that guides the operation when 
not to produce (prevents overproduction). 
3. Local efficiencies must be abolished. 4. A focusing process to balance flow must be in place.
