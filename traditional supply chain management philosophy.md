## traditional supply chain management philosophy

<b>traditional supply chain management philosophy</b> - A philosophy of managing a supply chain that focuses on local optimization to achieve maximum short-term organizational profits.  Costs associated with such items as purchasing and transportation lot sizes, materials handling, warehouse and stock locations, etc. are minimized under the assumption that these cost savings translate into additional organization profit.  Worker and equipment utilizations and efficiencies are maximized in an attempt to minimize product cost.  These actions generally result in a push system with a small central warehouse and inventories located throughout the supply chain (based on forecasts of item demand and with each link attempting to minimize its own costs. Lot sizes are generally based on ROP/EOQ or min-max levels for each item.  The underlying principle of a traditional supply chain is that "the sum of the local optima is equal to the global optima."
