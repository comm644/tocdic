## white buffer status

<b>white buffer status</b> -  - In general, an indication that a manufacturing order was released earlier than required.



Usage: In make-to-availability, white buffer status means that a production work order was released when the stock in the system (on-hand plus stock in transport plus open work orders in work-in-process) exceeds the stock target level. Inventory-dollar-days should be charged to the item until the buffer level drops to or below the buffer target.  White buffer status is a measure of doing things that should not be done.
