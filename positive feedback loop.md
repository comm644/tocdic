## positive feedback loop

<b>positive feedback loop</b> -  - A set of logical cause-and-effect relationships that is connected in such a way that it produces an increasing (positive) condition or behavior within a system.





Usage: A positive feedback loop is always a reinforcing feedback loop depending on the starting situation.  Positive reinforcing loops are active in a well-performing system; that is they are steadily improving over time.  In general, feedback involves both the transmission and the return of information.  Since feedback loops exist in all real systems, it is important to actively identify and record negative feedback loops in any current reality and replace them with positive feedback loops in future reality tree diagrams, both for correct diagnosis and to utilize for effecting an improvement.  Entities in a feedback loop are good candidates for leverage points.  

Illustration: If 10 We continually reduce the time per set-up and 15 We increase the number of setups to increase flow then 20 We run smaller batches and sequence them by due date.  If 20 We run smaller batches and sequence them by due date then 30 We release materials that support orders. And if 30 We release materials that support orders then 40 We maintain the protective capacity of the work center.  Cause-and-effect loops back from 40 and 10 to 20 because maintaining protective capacity reinforces running smaller batches.
