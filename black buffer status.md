<b>black buffer status</b> - In general, an indication that the system failed to deliver its commitment.  1. In make-to-order drum-buffer-rope or simplified drum-buffer-rope, the status of a manufacturing order is black when the due date of the customer order is earlier than the current date (the order is late with respect to customer due date.). 2. In make-to-availability, the buffer status is black when the on-hand inventory of an SKU that is committed to availability is zero and there is actual demand for more items. 3. In critical chain project management, the project status is black when the project due date is earlier than the current date (the project is late with respect to customer due date).
