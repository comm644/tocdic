<b>deployment chart</b> -  A document used in TOC critical chain implementations that depicts the current technical, managerial, and management information system procedures that are used for managing the flow of customer orders or products, information, and decisions.

Usage: The deployment chart provides a clear understanding of where injections from the future reality tree and prerequisite tree (or strategy and tactics tree) fit in the processes, which processes and procedures have to be changed or replaced, and how the new and old processes interact for an effective planning and control system.
