<b>complexity</b> -  - Traditionally, the more data elements  that are needed to describe (the parts and interdependencies in) a system the more complex the system is (defined as detail complexity).  In theory of constraints as in the hard sciences, the more degrees of freedom a system has the more complex the system is (defined as conceptual complexity).  
Example: Suppose you had the two systems portrayed as System A and System B.  Which system is more complex?  Most people would say System B since it has far more data points than System A.  But if the four points in System A are independent and the arrows in System B are cause-and-effect arrows, then System B is the simpler system.  In System A four points have to be changed in order to change the system but in System B, because the arrows are cause-and-effect relationships, only one point (the point with no incoming arrows) has to be changed to impact the whole system.
