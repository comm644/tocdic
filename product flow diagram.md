## product flow diagram

<b>product flow diagram</b> -   - A diagram of a production system that shows the material flow from raw materials to finished products through the system.



Usage: In a product flow diagram, each operation performed by a resource is indicated by a separate representation of the resource.  If, for example, resource R1 performs four different operations, the symbol for R1 will appear four times on the product flow diagram.  A product flow diagram illustrates both the material dependency of products and processes as well as resource dependency, or what resources are required to produce each end item. 

Syn.:[[logical product structure]].
