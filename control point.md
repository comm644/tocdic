<b>control point</b> - A key point in the flow of work through an operations environment that, if not managed properly, has a high probability of decreasing throughput and due date performance.  
Usage: Control points include gating operations, convergent points, divergent points, constraints, and shipping points. In TOC operations management, sequencing schedules at the control points to match the drum schedule and/or shipping schedule increases the probability of on-time performance. the drum schedule and/or shipping schedule increases the probability of on-time performance.
