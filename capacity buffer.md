## capacity buffer

<b>capacity buffer</b> - - 1. In multi-project critical chain project management, a time buffer placed in the project plan immediately in front of the first use of the drum resource to protect the start of the project against variation (Murphy) from drum tasks in upstream projects.  
Usage 1: A capacity buffer enables project acceleration if the drum resource is available early.  Capacity buffers are only used in multi-project environments. 
2. In a make-to-availability environment, extra capacity of the capacity-constrained resource or other heavily loaded resources that is available quickly and at a reasonable cost (possibly through subcontracting) to react to sudden increases in total demand.
