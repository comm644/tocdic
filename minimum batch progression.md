## minimum batch progression

<b>minimum batch progression</b> -  - The distance, in terms of a manufacturing routing, a minimum batch progresses through a manufacturing process.



Usage: Some production operations require a minimum batch size (for example, due to the size of a mold).  Frequently this minimum batch size is greater than the customer order size.  In these cases it might be wise to hold the excess work-in-process inventory immediately after the production operation requiring the minimum batch so that excess finished good are not produced.  In V-plants, holding work-in-process inventories after this stage might protect against demand from a number of products; the alternative is to attempt to forecast which finished product will require the finished-goods inventory first.
