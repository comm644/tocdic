## science

<b>science</b> - The search for a minimum number of assumptions that will enable one to explain, by direct logical deduction, the maximum number of natural phenomena. These assumptionsâlike the gravitational lawâcan never be proven.  Even when they can explain an infinite number of phenomena this does not make them true.  It simply makes them valid.  They can still be disproved.  One phenomenon that cannot be explained makes the assumption false, but in doing so it does not detract from its validity. It simply puts the boundaries on the circumstances where the assumption is valid and exposes the opportunity to find another assumption that is even more valid.  Science does not concern itself with 


truths but with validity.  That's the reason everything in science is open for constant checks and challenges.
