## chronic conflict

<b>chronic conflict</b> - A contentious situation that has existed for a prolonged period of time. Opposing sides have been justifying their perspective through selective requirements and prerequisites for so long that both sides become entrenched in their own beliefs to the point that neither side can see how to break the conflict without suffering a significant loss. 


Usage: Breaking a chronic conflict requires understanding the opposing perspectives. This understanding can lead to the surfacing of hidden assumptions underlying entity relationships that are often the key to creating a breakthrough solution. The solution to a chronic conflict requires one side to offer up a problematic (from their perspective) injection and the other side to somehow eliminate any of the undesirable aspects of the proposed injection using the negative branch reservation process. 

Perspective: The main difference between the day-to-day conflict cloud and the chronic conflict cloud is the extent to which the unresolved conflict has deteriorated the trust between the parties. When trust is high, a conflict can be broken with the traditional approach (i.e. both sides working together to break it on either side) but with a chronic conflict, the cloud should be broken on the side of the initiator (or else consensus might never be achieved) but the initiator should then request assistance from the other side to help find a way to eliminate the negative branches related to giving them what they want.
