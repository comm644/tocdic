## non-constraint

<b>non-constraint</b> - Resources that have more capacity (many times idle) than the system constraint.  Instead of attempting to achieve their full utilization, non-constraints should subordinate themselves to support the constraint in achieving the system's goal.  Non-constraint capacity is divided into productive capacity (time to support the constraint production), protective capacity (time needed to catch up when Murphy strikes) and excess capacity (time available for addition throughput opportunities or available for trimming).
