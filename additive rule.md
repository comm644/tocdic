## additive rule

<b>additive rule</b> -  - This rule states that local values of a given parameter can be added together to calculate the global value. 


Perspective: In the cost-world paradigm, the cost savings in one department are added to the cost savings in every other department to determine overall impact; in this manner the cost-world paradigm follows the additive rule when it claims that global improvement is the sum of all the local improvements. In the throughput-world paradigm of TOC, the throughput of one department can NOT be added to the throughput of every other department to determine global throughput; thus throughput does not follow the additive rule. In the throughput-world paradigm global improvement is NOT the sum of all the local improvements.
