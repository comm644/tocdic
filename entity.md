## entity

<b>entity</b> -  A statement, generally in a rectangle or rectangle with rounded corners, that describes a part of the system being studied using a thinking processes diagram.  


Usage:  Effects, causes, actions, conditions, injections, intermediate objectives, and obstacles are all considered to be entities. An entity should be stated as a complete sentence; however, the statement should not be a compound or a complex sentence and should not contain a cause-and-effect relationship.


Illustration: The phrase, 20 Car battery, is not a valid entity.  However, 20 The car battery is dead, is a valid entity because it is a complete sentence.
