## parallel assumption

<b>parallel assumption</b> - An entity in a strategy and tactics tree; a statement that answers the questions of why the strategy is possible or under what conditions the strategy is possible, and why the tactic is the best way to achieve the strategy, i.e., what specific risks, constraints and obstacles were considered in selecting the tactic as the best or only way to achieve the strategy?
