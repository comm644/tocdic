## productive capacity

<b>productive capacity</b> - - Resource capacity that is required to produce output sufficient to satisfy the demand of the constraint. 


Perspective: Resource capacity is divided into two types: productive and idle.  Idle capacity is further divided into protective and excess. While some believe that all capacity beyond productive capacity is waste, TOC claims that some protective capacity is needed at non-constraint resources in order to protect the throughput of the system.  When everything is running smoothly there might be considerable idle capacity.  But when Murphy strikes some protective capacity is needed to fill the buffers back up.  Capacity above protective is excess capacity and provides management additional sales opportunities. 

Syn.:[[sprint capacity]].
