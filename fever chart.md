## fever chart

<b>fever chart</b> - A graph showing the status of a project or multiple projects.  The graph has percentage of project buffer consumed on the vertical axis and percentage of critical chain completed on the horizontal axis.  The colors red, yellow, and green represent project status.



Usage: One approach to drawing the regions is as follows: if the buffer burn rate is something less than 1.0, the project status is green.  If the buffer burn rate is approximately 1.0, the project status is yellow.  If the buffer burn rate is something greater than 1, the project status is red.  The project manager is responsible for determining the boundaries of the yellow zone.


Illustration 1: The graph on the left below reflects the status of a single project.  The points (1, 2, 3 .â¦) represent status reporting dates (weekly, for example) over time.  

Illustration 2: The graph on the right below reflects the status of multiple projects.  The points (A, B, C â¦.) represent the status of different projects at a given point in time. 

 
 

Caution: Buffer status (red, yellow, or green) as reflected in a fever chart may differ from buffer status reflected by the buffer region percentages (red, yellow and green boundaries).
