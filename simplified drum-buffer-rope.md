## simplified drum-buffer-rope

<b>simplified drum-buffer-rope</b> - (S-DBR) - The process of managing operations based upon the market drum and a shipping buffer (in this application called a production buffer) while monitoring the planned load on any capacity-constrained resources. More recent developments of S-DBR have added a mechanism to quote safe dates for delivery. 


Usage: S-DBR can be used in the vast majority of shop floors with the one exception of having sequence-dependent setups.  The rationale of S-DBR is that the market demand is the major constraint, but it does not preclude the possibility having a capacity-constrained resource(s).  The capacity control in S-DBR is done through the planned load. It only uses one type of buffer, namely, the production buffer.
