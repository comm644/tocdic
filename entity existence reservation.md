<b>entity existence reservation</b> -  - A level II reservation in the categories of legitimate reservation that is used to challenge the validity of a proposed statement of fact, whether part of a logic tree or not.
Usage: The scrutinizer of a thinking processes diagram may ask the question: "Does this entity really exist in your world as you have stated it?" The presenter then either proves its existence, or modifies the entity or removes it from the logic diagram. Illustration:  For example, when scrutinizing the following entity a scrutinizer might say, "Please explain how entity 50 is possible."
