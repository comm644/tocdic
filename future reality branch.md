## future reality branch

<b>future reality branch</b> - A thinking processes sufficiency-based logic diagram for examining potential solutions before they are implemented.



Usage: A future reality branch is similar to a future reality tree except that it is used to test and solve problems related to evaluating a specific action or evaporating a cloud.  It is the result of applying the negative branch reservation process.
