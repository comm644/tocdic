## flying pig injection

<b>flying pig injection</b> - - Colloquial term used to describe a breakthrough solution or injection that initially seems impossible to implement.



Perspective: A flying pig injection is so named because it appears to be so difficult to achieve that it has the same near zero probability of occurrence as seeing a flying pig. 

Illustration:  The securing of a $100 million loan to finance the development of a new, un-patentable product for a 25 year old recent engineering graduate would be considered, by almost everyone, to be a flying pig injection.
