<b>A-plant</b> -  - A production environment that begins with a relatively large number of raw materials that pass through a succession of converging operations that create subassemblies, assemblies, and, finally, a relatively small number of end items. The letter A is used to represent the logical network of material flow, which has no relationship to the physical plant layout, because it is wide at the bottom (many raw materials), and converges at the top (few end products). 
Examples: The manufacture of helicopters, kitchen cabinets, and footwear.
