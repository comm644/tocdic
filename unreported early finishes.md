## unreported early finishes

<b>unreported early finishes</b> -  The practice of not reporting that a task is finished early based on the belief to do so would cause negative side effects. 


Illustration: A common negative side effect of reporting the early completion of a task is that the boss will demand that, in the future, similar tasks must be estimated at this shorter duration. Or, the worker may lose credibility if the boss concludes the original estimate of task duration was wrong and therefore the worker must not know his/her job very well. For these reasons, workers frequently do not report an early finish. 



See:[[Parkinson's Law]].
