## drum resource

<b>drum resource</b> - The resource that serves as the drum for the organization. 


Usage: In operations, two situations can exist.  The drum resource can be a constraint or capacity- constrained resource.  In using drum-buffer-rope the scheduling and execution of the drum resource are based on the drum (constraint schedule).  In simplified drum-buffer-rope, scheduling and execution are based on the market being the drum with secondary attention directed to any capacity-constrained resource.  In both situations, the drum resource is managed by buffer management.
