## staggering

<b>staggering</b> -  In multi-project critical chain project management, the process of releasing projects based on the availability and capability or capacity of the drum or virtual drum.



Usage: Once the drum resource has completed the last task on one project, another comparable project is released to execution.  Staggering limits the number of projects being worked on at one time.
