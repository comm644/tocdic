## critical success factor

<b>critical success factor</b> - (CSF)- High level requirements or necessary conditions that must be satisfied to ensure attainment of the system's goal.



Usage: CSFs represent terminal outcomes, very few in number (perhaps no more than three to five), that are high level from the perspective of the whole system.  Each CSF has necessary conditions that are prerequisites to its accomplishment.  The only real difference between CSFs and necessary conditions is their proximity to goal attainment and their degree of specificity.

CSFs represent the second level (below the system goal) of an intermediate objectives map used to 
establish the benchmark of system success for strategy development or for system-level problem solving.
