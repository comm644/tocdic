## protective capacity

<b>protective capacity</b> -  Resource capacity needed to protect the throughput of the system by ensuring that some capacity above the capacity required to exploit the constraint is available to catch up when disruptions inevitably occur.  Non-constraint resources need protective capacity to rebuild the bank in 

 
front of the constraint or capacity-constrained resource (CCR) to protect throughput and/or on the shipping dock to protect due date performance.  


Usage: Disruptions are the result of such things as normal variation in process times, unplanned downtime, late deliveries from suppliers, etc. Protective capacity is also called "sprint" capacity. Some practitioners believe that constraints and CCRs also need protective capacity so that "positive" uncertainty in the form of unexpected demand for more product or service by a key customer or market can be accommodated in the short term. Protective capacity is also required for the same reasons in a multi-project environment. If there is not enough protective capacity within a multi-project environment, variation can have a significant impact on the ability to complete the critical chain on time and keep the project on time. Lack of protective capacity can also disrupt the ability to maintain the drum schedule. 

Syn.:[[sprint capacity]].
