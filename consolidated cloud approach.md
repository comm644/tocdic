## consolidated cloud approach

<b>consolidated cloud approach</b> -  - The creation of a single evaporating cloud from three UDE clouds. 


Usage: The consolidated cloud explains the existence of the three UDEs used to create it.  The consolidated cloud approach is similar to the three-cloud approach but the resulting consolidated cloud may not reflect the core conflict due to the choice of the specific UDEs used to create the cloud.  The generic cloud that results from the three-cloud approach is thought to reflect the core problem.  A careful selection of diverse UDE helps ensure the core problem is identified correctly.
