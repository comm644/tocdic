## V-plant

<b>V-plant</b> -  A production environment characterized by a small number of raw material items being converted through a common series of diverging operations into a large number of end items. The logical network of material flow (not the physical flow) resembles the letter V in that it is narrow at the bottom (few raw materials), and diverges at the top (many end products). 


Examples: Steel making, plastic extrusion, and oil processing are examples of a V-plant.
