## negative branch reservation

<b>negative branch reservation</b> - (NBR) An unintended negative consequence  (i.e., new undesirable effect) of a proposed problem solution or injection.



Usage: NBRs require a secondary or trimming injection at the point where the tree branch starts turning negative in order to eliminate the negative outcome.  The process of adding a trimming injection is called "trimming the negative branch."  If the new UDE is significant, and a satisfactory trimming injection cannot be developed, the proposed primary injection must be reconsidered.
