## five focusing steps

<b>five focusing steps</b> - A systematic five-step approach used to continually improve a system's ability to produce goal units: 1. IDENTIFY the system's constraint(s). 2. Decide how to EXPLOIT the system's constraint(s). 3. SUBORDINATE everything else to the above decision. 4. ELEVATE the system's constraint(s). 5. WARNING!!!! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow INERTIA to cause a system's constraint.
One of three processes of ongoing improvement in TOC.
