## ambitious target tree

<b>ambitious target tree</b> - -A necessity-based logic diagram that facilitates the construction of  strategic and tactical plans in order to achieve an ambitious target by analyzing obstacles and developing intermediate objectives.


Usage: The logic of the ambitious target tree is not subject to sufficiency reservations.  The tree in total should be subjected to a completeness reservation, however, by asking whether the tree includes everything needed in order to achieve the ambitious target.

 
The ambitious target tree is similar to the prerequisite tree and is commonly used by Theory of 
Constraints for Education (TOCfE) advocates in teaching children and in school administration project planning.
