<b>breakage</b> -  In TOC, a condition in which the constraint is forced to be idle because the resource has broken down. 
Usage: Non-constraints have excess capacity so breakage at a non-constraint is not a significant concern.  The impact of non-constraint breakage on the constraint is reduced by the use of constraint and space time buffers.  However, breakage of the constraint has significant impact because it generally results in a reduction in throughput.  Three sources of lost throughput in a drum-buffer-rope are: starvation, blockage, and breakage of the constraint.
 are: starvation, blockage, and breakage of the constraint.
