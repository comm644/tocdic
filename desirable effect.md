## desirable effect

<b>desirable effect</b> - (DE)-  A positive or beneficial outcome associated with an organization's actual or future performance.  


Usage: A DE is often the opposite of an undesirable effect (UDE). When appearing in a future reality tree, DEs may be either exact opposites of their corresponding UDEs or they may be conditions that signify that the undesirable aspects present in a current reality tree have been overcome. Example 1: For the UDE "Throughput is declining," the corresponding DE would be, "Throughput is increasing." Example 2: For the UDE "Production lead times are too long," the corresponding DE could be "Production lead times are less than competitors' lead times."
