## dual-cloud process

<b>dual-cloud process</b> -  - A process for considering the unresolved conflicts related to causes and consequences of undesirable effects (UDEs) separately when developing clouds.



Usage: In the dual-cloud process, the assumed cause (i.e., specific actions or rules) of a UDE are addressed in a systemic conflict cloud to derive "D" and consequences of a UDE (i.e., the actions or rules that the one dealing with the UDE feels pressure to take to deal with the UDE) are addressed in a symptomatic conflict cloud.  The two clouds are connected through the UDE in that D of the systemic cloud creates the undesirable effect and D of the symptomatic cloud is an action that must be taken to remove the UDE.
