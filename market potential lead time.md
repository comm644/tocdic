## market potential lead time

<b>market potential lead time</b> -  The point in time where a customer is willing to pay a premium for a product or service.



Example: Suppose the industry lead time for a product is 5 weeks.  Most customers will base their business on this being the standard.  However, customers may be willing to pay a premium for faster deliveries, for example, a 25% price premium for a 3 week delivery, a 50% premium for a 2 week delivery, and so on.  In the absence of suppliers with the ability to respond quickly, the market may be unaware of these premium opportunities.  Overnight shipping is an example of this market potential lead time.
