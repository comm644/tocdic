## demand driven material requirements planning

<b>demand driven material requirements planning</b> -  (DDMRP) - A method of planning inventories that involves five components:

1.  inventory positioning 2.  grouping of parts into buffer profiles based on lead time; variability in demand and supply; whether 
the part is made, bought or distributed; and whether significant order multiples are involved 
3.  dynamic buffers 4.  planning rules that tie supply orders to consumption 5.  visible and collaborative execution 

  

Perspective: Traditional MRP systems are push systems based on forecasts of demand for finished 
products and generally focus on local optima throughout the supply chain.  In contrast, DDMRP is a pull system based on strategic placement of inventories across the supply chain with strategic buffers positioned for critical raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and possibly distribution inventories.  The system is based on measures such as buffer status that better reflect both a firm's and a supply chain's ability to respond effectively to customer demand.
