## strategic buffer

<b>strategic buffer</b> -  Amounts of time, stock, or capacity effectively located at leverage points in the production, supply chain, or critical chain to protect the system from disruption.

 Perspective 1: In lean manufacturing buffers are located between each pair of sequential workstations. In TOC buffers are located at leverage points (raw materials, constraint, after major divergent points, convergent points, shipping (central warehouse).  Smaller buffers are located at regional warehouses/distributors and retailers where frequent replenishment occurs.


 
Perspective 2:  In traditional project management buffers are included in each task time estimate.  In critical chain protection is stripped from the tasks and strategically inserted at feeding and project completion locations.
