<b>blockage</b> -   In TOC, a condition in which the constraint is forced to be idle because downstream workstations are not able to accept the material processed by the constraint and storage space for the material is not available. 
Usage: Blocking, starvation, and breakage of the constraint are of particular importance in theory of constraints as throughput is lost.  In contrast, in traditional manufacturing this term applies to non-constraints as well.  In a serial line with a constraint midway in the process, blocking occurs when the constraint doesn't have space to offload finished units and therefore must sit idle until space is freed up. Three sources of lost throughput in a drum-buffer-rope are: starvation, blockage, and breakage of the constraint.
